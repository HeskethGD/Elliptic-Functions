# Elliptic-Functions
Mathematical research with nonlinear coupled differential equations and elliptic functions. Uses Python, Jupyter, sympy, and mpmath.

This work is interested in:
- Solving nonlinear coupled differential equations analytically, often in terms of elliptic functions
- Establishing new ways to analyse associated concepts in physics and to obtain new physical insights from the mathematics
- Discovering new methods and techniques for solving nonlinear coupled mode differential equations that are generalisable to other physical models
- Researching new ideas in symmetry (in particular Parity Time PT symmetry), conservation laws, and Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
- Exploring how to approach such research using open source tools such as Python, sympy and mpmath
